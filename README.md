# Uncertainty Quantification for AMPL Point Predictions

## Overview
This repository contains the routines and functions used for the MSSE capstone project.The goal of this project was to build and compare various classification modelsâ€™ and their ability to classify NEK2 binders and inhibitors. This project, was guided by the Open Data and Models group at the Accelerating Therapeutics for Opportunities in Medicine (ATOM) Consortium. The data is provided by Chembl, but it is not included here as an extra precaution.
